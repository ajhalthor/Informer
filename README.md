## Architecture Diagram
The HTML file to all the architecture diagrams is present in the `informer_architecture.html`. It consists of 6 tabs:
1. Full Attention Vs Prob Sparse Attention
2. Time complexity analysis for each
3. attention + distillation
4. Embedding architecture  
5. Encoder architecture 
6. Complete Encoder-Decoder architecture
