# Informer
Here are the files to build the informer from scratch. Follow [this YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTl9hO2Oobd8Ul2XpG9bwoTOvNY0EazbT) for an explanation of each.

## Architecture Diagram
The architecture diagram is too large to display. Hence sharing the raw file `Informer_architecture.drawio` file. To access the image:
1. Clone the repo locally
2. Open draw.io in browser
3. When prompted to open, click "Open Existing Diagram"
4. A dialog box opens
5. Select the local file `Informer_architecture.drawio`
